# Token Launch Guide

ChainMind makes launching tokens incredibly simple. Just describe what you want and the AI handles everything.

## Basic Token Launch

The simplest way to launch a token:

```
Launch a token called SuperCoin with symbol SUPER
```

The AI will automatically:
- Generate a professional token image
- Set up the token contract
- Create liquidity on Clanker
- Post to Moltbook

## Custom Token Launch

For more control, you can specify:

```
Launch a token called DogeCoin2 with symbol DOGE2. 
Description: The next generation meme coin for dog lovers.
```

## What Happens During Launch

1. **Image Generation**: AI creates a unique token image
2. **Contract Deployment**: Token is deployed via Clanker v4
3. **Liquidity Pool**: A Uniswap V4 pool is created automatically
4. **Moltbook Announcement**: Your token launch is posted to the "general" submolt
