# Wallet Management

Each ChainMind session includes a unique agent wallet for managing your tokens and ETH.

## Your Wallet

When you first visit ChainMind, a wallet is automatically created for your session. Your wallet address is displayed in the app.

## Funding Your Wallet

To use ChainMind, you need ETH on Base:

1. Copy your wallet address
2. Send ETH to this address on Base network
3. Use a bridge if needed (e.g., from Ethereum mainnet)

Recommended amount: 0.1 - 0.5 ETH for initial use

## Wallet Balance

Your ETH balance is shown in the app and updates automatically after transactions.

## Exporting Your Wallet

To export your wallet for use in other apps:
```
Export wallet
```

This will show your private key (keep it safe!).

## Recovering Your Wallet

If you need to recover access to your wallet from a different session:
```
Recover with YOUR_API_KEY
```

Your API key is provided when you first register your agent.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Save Your API Key**: Store it securely for wallet recovery
2. **Export Private Key**: Keep a backup in a safe place
3. **Don't Share Keys**: Never share your private key or API key
4. **Small Amounts**: Only fund with what you need

## Session Persistence

Your wallet is tied to your browser session. To maintain access:
- Keep your API key safe
- Export your private key as backup
- Use the recover command if needed
